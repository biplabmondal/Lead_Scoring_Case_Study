**Building Logistic regression Model to identify the potential leads.**

X Education, an online course provider, grapples with a subpar lead conversion rate of around 30%, prompting their quest for an efficient means to identify high-potential leads, colloquially known as 'Hot Leads.' These are individuals with a greater likelihood of converting into paying customers. The ultimate objective is to raise the lead conversion rate to approximately 80%, a challenging target set by the CEO.

A comprehensive dataset of approximately 9,240 leads, encompassing attributes like Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, and Last Activity, has been provided for analysis. The dataset's focal point is the 'Converted' column, where '1' signifies conversion and '0' non-conversion. Notably, certain categorical variables contain a 'Select' level that equates to a null value.

The primary goal is to construct a logistic regression model that assigns lead scores ranging from 0 to 100, facilitating the identification of potential leads for targeted engagement. A higher score denotes a 'Hot Lead,' while a lower score indicates a less likely conversion. The model must also adapt to future changes and challenges, as outlined in a separate document.

Expected deliverables include a well-documented Jupyter notebook with the logistic regression model, conversion predictions, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, a Word document should be completed, addressing all problems presented by the company based on the logistic regression model's outcomes. The final presentation should encapsulate the analysis approach, results in business terms, visualisations, and key takeaways, serving as a comprehensive summary of the assignment's progression and insights gained.
